# ONZORG
### Inspiration
we realized the lack of proper framework for providing medical facilities.

### What it does
A website right at your fingertips providing numerous medical facilities to people all around. Our main objective being the provision of immediate help to the patients at the time of any medical emergency.

Even doctors or any other medical representatives can get a super easy access to the dilemmas of their patients.** Onzorg** is a much needed tool in today's fast paced world.

### How we built it
This project has been developed on the platform VISUAL STUDIO CODE using languages like **HTML,CSS,JS** at front end and **PHP/MYSQL** at the back end.

### Challenges we ran into
we all are budding programmers and quite new in this field which itself was a major challenge.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite having minimal knowledge and experience in this field we made significant progress in our web development project.

### What we learned
We learned a whole lot of things during this project such as making and editing videos, presentation, using Git and many more.

### What's next for Onzorg
Incorporating as much features as possible in the coming future.
